        <h3>What changes I have made<h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Smaller images(kb)</li>
              <li>Added alt text</li>
              <li>Deleted some comments in js</li>
              <li>Underlined when hover over the ul in the footer</li>
            </ol>
          <h3>How I changed it</h3>
          <p>I uploaded the resized images on my wordpress site and entered alt text at the same time.
            I underlined the ul in the footer with footer div ul li a:hover {
              text-decoration: underline;
            }
            Somehow along the way while adjusting my page, my images and titles on the blog page got wrong. Some of my images and titles are mixed up, but some are still where they should be. I have tried to fix it, but I have not been able to. I do apologize for that.</p>

            </ol>
          <h3>How I changed it</h3>
          <p>I added a border-bottom to the page to make it easier to see the border between the header and body. I moved the stylesheet into the head. I added max-width: auto; on the images. I have added Verdana, Geneva and Tahoma in sans-serif. Changed the colour on the contact link in the footer to white.</p>
          
          <h3>Why I changed it</h3>
          <p>In my cross-course delivery I looked at the feedback to fix my mistakes. I looked at it and saw that every error was simple errors, just like the link to the stylesheet. </p>
